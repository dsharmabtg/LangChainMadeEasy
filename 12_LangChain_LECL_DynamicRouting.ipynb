       "{'response': \"Correct Answer: Penguins are flightless birds that belong to the family Spheniscidae.\\n\\nExplanation: Penguins are a group of aquatic birds that are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. They are characterized by their distinctive black and white feathers, which help them blend in with the sea and sky, making it easier for them to hunt and avoid predators. Penguins are flightless birds, meaning they are not able to fly like other birds. This is due to their unique body shape, which includes a streamlined body, short wings, and powerful flippers.\\n\\nPenguins are excellent swimmers, using their flippers to propel themselves through the water in search of food. They are carnivorous, feeding on a variety of prey such as fish, krill, and squid. Penguins are highly social animals, often living in large colonies and engaging in complex behaviors such as mating rituals and parental care.\\n\\nThere are 18 different species of penguins, ranging in size from the little blue penguin, which is the smallest, to the emperor penguin, which is the largest. Penguins are found in various habitats, including the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions, as well as in temperate and subtropical regions around the world.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that penguins have a unique way of breeding and reproducing. They lay a single egg per breeding season, which is incubated by the male penguin for several weeks while the female goes out to sea to feed. This unique breeding behavior is one of the reasons why penguins have been able to adapt to their environments and thrive in diverse habitats.\",\n",

       "{'response': \"**Correct Answer:** SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\nImagine you have two tables, `orders` and `customers`, and you want to see a list of customers along with their corresponding order information. However, the `orders` table contains a foreign key, `customer_id`, that references the `id` column in the `customers` table. This is where SQL joins come in.\\n\\nThere are three main types of SQL joins:\\n\\n1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows that have a match in both tables. If a row in the `orders` table doesn't have a matching `customer_id` in the `customers` table, it won't be included in the result.\\n2. **LEFT JOIN** (or **LEFT OUTER JOIN**): Returns all the rows from the left table (`orders`) and the matching rows from the right table (`customers`). If there's no match, the result will contain NULL values for the columns from the right table.\\n3. **RIGHT JOIN** (or **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**): Similar to the LEFT JOIN, but returns all the rows from the right table (`customers`) and the matching rows from the left table (`orders`).\\n4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all the rows from both tables, with NULL values in the columns where there's no match.\\n\\nHere's an example of how you might use an INNER JOIN:\\n```sql\\nSELECT *\\nFROM orders\\nINNER JOIN customers\\nON orders.customer_id = customers.id;\\n```\\nThis would return a result set with columns from both tables, where the `customer_id` in the `orders` table matches the `id` in the `customers` table.\\n\\nSQL joins are an essential tool for combining data from multiple tables in a database, and are used extensively in data analysis, reporting, and application development.\",\n",
